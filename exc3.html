Sulfuric acid (alternative spelling sulphuric acid) is a highly corrosive strong mineral acid with the molecular formula H <sub> 2 </sub> SO <sub>4</sub> and molecular weight 98.079 g/mol. It is a pungent-ethereal, colorless to slightly yellow viscous liquid that is soluble in water at all concentrations. Sometimes, it is dyed dark brown during production to alert people to its hazards. The historical name of this acid is oil of vitriol. <br>

<p> In physics, mass–energy equivalence is a concept formulated by Albert Einstein that explains the relationship between mass and energy. It expresses the law of equivalence of energy and mass using the formula </p>

E = m c <sup> 2 </sup> {\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}
{\displaystyle E=mc <sup> 2 </sup> {2}}

<p> Also here i have not applies p tag for 3rd para still it gies space as para </p>

where E is the energy of a physical system, m is the mass of the system, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum (about 3×108 m/s)
